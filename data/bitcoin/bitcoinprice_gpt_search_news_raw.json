        "summary": "Bitcoin experienced its first February price decline since 2014, with a notable drop to one-month lows near $8,500. This downturn invalidated the short-term bullish trend and raised concerns about Bitcoin's status as a safe-haven asset, especially as it failed to attract bids during a significant equity market sell-off. Despite this, some analysts believe the bullish trend of 2020 is not over, citing metrics like the market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score, which suggests Bitcoin remains undervalued. However, technical charts indicate a bearish outlook, with potential for further declines toward support levels around $8,213.
